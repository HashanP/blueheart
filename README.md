# blueheart
This is a simple web-based IDE. I use it to teach Haskell, at my school's [Algorithms Society](https://asociety.xyz). It started out as a web-based terminal, essentially SSH over HTTPS, but then I added a React-based IDE-style frontend, similar to Cloud9. At the moment it uses Docker containers, to run Haskell code in GHCI securely. To check out the older verison, which is just the web terminal, see the [1.x branch](https://github.com/HashanP/blueheart/tree/1.x).
